EDAS is now Mac/Linux compatable! It requires wine or mono to run.

Patch notes version 11-10
- changed where the json file is saved and added a backup file for cases where the auto update fails
- updated the help button for manual updating
- along with the previous fix added some catches and workarounds so that the program will work in wine/mono so that mac users- and that inevitable one guy running elite through a vm in linux- can use the program

Patch notes version 11-8-2
- fixed a catch for putting in coords
- added a distance feature when using coords

Patch notes version 11-8-1
- cleaned up the usings because there was a bunch of unused ones
- added in use of the date last updated field so you know how old the info for a system is
- added a catch for large search outputs so you don't have to sit through a database dump on accident
- output for needs_permit now shows true and false instead of 1 and 0

Patch notes version 11-7 first real commit to github woo! 
don't feel like going over the features here its all in the in program help button anyway
